                                    <div class="content" style="width:50%;"><p>The career journey I began as an undergraduate electrical engineering student began my life-long love affair with solving complicated problems. The biggest struggle I encountered was not the homework, the labs, or the projects â€” instead I fought tooth and nail with the software and engineering tools, which had been developed without <i>any</i> consideration of the people who had to use them. I didn't realize it then, but I was learning first hand about the importance of user experience.</p>

                                    <p>After discovering that engineering didn't have the kinds of problems I was passionate about solving, I found the UT iSchool where I learned how to listen to and learn from the users. Above all else, I believe that delivering an excellent product requires keeping <i>the users</i> in mind from the very beginning. Relying on the opinions of programmers, designers, or even the CEO leads to products <i>they</i> love, not products that people actually use. </p></div>
